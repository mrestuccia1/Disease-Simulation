# Disease-Simulation
A realistic disease simulation model that includes randomness, vaccines, and mutation of the disease, fully implemented in Typed Racket (a modern dialect of list, which allows the incremental addition of statically-checked type annotations). This was implemented using the vectors data structure in Racket. This was animated using the big bang syntactic form.
